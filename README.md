Extending the Multiclipboard
Extend the multiclipboard program in this chapter so that it has a delete <keyword> command line argument that will delete a keyword from the shelf. Then add a delete command line argument that will delete all keywords.
Mad Libs
Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file. For example, a text file may look like this:

The adjective adverb rose and verb the biggest thing I’ve ever seen, as I walked and reached the noun I fell and rolled down the hill.(I plan finishing in the morning


The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was
unaffected by these events.
The program would find these occurrences and prompt the user to replace them.
Enter an adjective:
silly
Enter a noun:
chandelier
Enter a verb:
screamed
Enter a noun:
pickup truck
The following text file would then be created:
The silly panda walked to the chandelier and then screamed. A nearby pickup
truck was unaffected by these events.
The results should be printed to the screen and saved to a new text file.
